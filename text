Our intention is to create an application to address the issue of food wastage.

We intend to reduce food wastage by taking reducing the amount of food that is bought but not consumed.

In order to address this, we will be developing an app which takes into account the number of people are consuming the meal,
frequency of dining in or dining out. The application will then come up with a suggested amount of food that needs to be bought on a weekly basis, 
based on these eating habits. The consumers are then able to have a more accurate estimation of the amount of food that they should be buying. 

Should there still be leftovers, the application will then suggest meals that can be made from the leftovers. 

Features that should be implemented: 1) number of consumers 2) frequency of cooking at home 3) age and size relating to diet (recommended dietary intake) 
4) frequency of exercise (lifestyle) 5) ease of logging in (link to Google?) 6) Dietary preferences, can give options and for each category, there are options
for the user to swap, eg swap chicked with beef, so long as the caloric amount is, but there are some assumptions will be made

Features that are optional / for the future: 1) progress 2) intensity of workout 3) tracking of past eating habits

From the features, we will estimate how much the consumer will eat

Implementation of the application 

Make the app web-based first, with no requirement to log in or link to any social networking account yet
