_Topic: Food Wastage_

# Problem:

- Households often buy excess food or ingredients that are not consumed, causing them to expire or be stored indefinitely.

# Solution:

- An app that gives the user a suggested list of ingredients to buy in order to reduce wastage, based on: how often they cook at home, number of family members, lifestyle and body type

# Implementation:

- The application will then come up with a suggested amount of food that needs to be bought on a weekly basis, based on the information provided. The consumers are then able to have a more accurate estimation of the amount of food that they should be buying.

Features that should be implemented:

1. number of consumers
2. frequency of cooking at home
3. age and size relating to diet (recommended dietary intake)
4. frequency of exercise (lifestyle)
5. ease of logging in (link to Google?)
6. Dietary preferences, can give options and for each category, there are options for the user to swap, eg swap chicked with beef, so long as the caloric amount is, but there are some assumptions will be made

- The application will be web-based to start without the need to log in with any account.
- The user will be able to download the generated SMART grocery list

# Extra Features:

- Should there still be leftovers, the application will then suggest meals that can be made from the leftovers.
- progress
- intensity of workout
- tracking of past eating habits
- From the features, we will estimate how much the consumer will eat

# More on Calories:
- While this application that we are proposing is not a fitness application, we aim to use calories to estimate the amount of food that the user
should be eating for the meal, based on the various factors mentioned above
- Calories are units of energy that are contributed by one of three macronutrients, which are fats, carbohydrates and protein
- As such, the amount of food will be estimated through the suggested calorie intake
